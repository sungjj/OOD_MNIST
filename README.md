# OOD_MNIST
[Out-of-Distribution Detection with Semantic
Mismatch under Masking by Yijun Yang, Ruiyuan Gao, and Qiang Xu](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2022/papers_ECCV/papers/136840369.pdf)

This project performs Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection utilizing the main method described in the above paper.

The current goal is to enhance this method through additional research.

## Dataset
MNIST

In-distribution : 1~9

Out-of-distribution : 0

## Train process

## OOD detection Result
alpha: 1.5 beta: 0.95

zero accuracy : 97.1178

else accuracy : 97.0950,


## Points that can be improved

The latent vector of VAE can be used for classification

After the classification, we can discriminate whether the image corresponds to the label through a conditional discriminator. If it doesnâ€™t, it is classified as out-of-distribution data.

Through this process, out-of-distribution data can be filtered out in two stages.
